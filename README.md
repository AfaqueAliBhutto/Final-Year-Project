# Final-Year-Project
This repository contains the details of my Final Year Project. and the topic for my FYP is Improvements in Medical Ultrasound Beamforming Quality using Deep Learning.

 

# Project Milestones were Being Discussed and set in the meeting

Following are the milestones set for **Evaluation 1** and that will be held on **11th March 2021**.

1. MATLAB and Ultrasound Field-II Toolbox based Delay_and_ Sum (DAS) Beamforming Simulation
2. Image Quality Matrix (Computational time)
3. Minimum Variance Beamformer using MATLAB with Quality Matrix and Computational Time

Following are the milestones set for **Evaluation 2** and that will be held on **30th March 2021**.

4. Neural Network based Minimum Variance  Weight Calculation (Pyhton or MATLAB)
5. Quality Matrix 
6. Improve the Network

Final Evalution  will be held on **15th April 2021**

7. Write-up 


**Note:**
The file named DAS1_TF is the pdf of jupeter notebook where we got results by using the example code given by Stanford Professor and datasets given on the website of PICMUS.
